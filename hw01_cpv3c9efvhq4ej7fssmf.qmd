## Instructions

1.  **Clone the Homework Repository**\
    Clone the GitHub repository containing the homework file to your **local machine**.

2.  **Rename the File**\
    Rename the `.qmd` file from `hw01.qmd` to: `hw01_yourusername.qmd`.\

For example: `hw01_semiyari.qmd`

### Working on Your Homework

-   As you complete each part of the homework:

    -   **Stage** and **commit** your `.qmd` file *after each question/sub-question*, such as `1.1`, `1.2`, etc.\
    -   **Render** your `.qmd` file to **HTML only** (no PDF or Word formats).\
    -   **Push** your updates to GitHub after completing each **main question**, such as `1.0`, `2.0`, etc.

> Committing and pushing to GitHub **are graded components** of this assignment.

## Final Checks Before Submission

-   **Re-render** to HTML before your final commit and push.\

-   **Check your output:**\

    -   Make sure **all images display correctly**.\
    -   Avoid including **excessive output or large datasets** unless asked.

## Final Submission

Once you have finished and pushed your final version:

-   Copy the link of your **GitHub Pages site** (where the rendered HTML is published).
-   **Post the link** to the Canvas assignment submission page.

```{r}
# Install pacman if it's not already installed
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")

# Use pacman to install (if needed) and load the packages
pacman::p_load(pacman, tidyverse,
               nycflights13)
```

-   Consider the data in the nycflights13 package.

-   **Problem 2**: Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?

```{r}
# Cleaning and structuring data

flights2 <- flights %>% 
  select(tailnum, dep_delay) %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_delay  =  mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

planes2 <- planes %>% 
  select(tailnum, year)


df <- planes2 %>% 
  left_join(flights2, join_by(tailnum))
```

-   **Problem 3**: Find the 10 days of the year that have the highest median departure delay, then select all flights from those 10 days.

```{r}
head(flights)
help(flights)
```
